Commit 585be84 temporary are the last working version.
!!! This version minicloud (585be84) can download files that have not been added to it as an argument, so it is recommended to use it on behalf of a user who does not have access to files other than those that are planned to be distributed

Next commits cannot upload files for now. I am gradually adding and rewriting the functionality of the program
